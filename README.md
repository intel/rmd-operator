----------
Kubernetes Operator designed to provision and manage Intel [Resource Management Daemon (RMD)](https://github.com/intel/rmd) instances in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites
* Node Feature Discovery ([NFD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery)) should be deployed in the cluster before running the operator. Once NFD has applied labels to nodes with capabilities compatible with RMD, such as *Intel L3 Cache Allocation Technology*, the operator can deploy RMD on those nodes. 
Note: NFD is recommended, but not essential. Node labels can also be applied manually. See the [NFD repo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery#feature-labels) for a full list of features labels.
* A working RMD container image from the [RMD repo](https://github.com/intel/rmd) compatible with the RMD Operator (see compatiblilty table below).  

### Compatibility
|  RMD Version | RMD Operator Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| v0.1 | N/A |
| v0.2 | v0.1 |
| v0.3 | v0.2 |

## Setup

### Debug Mode
To use the operator with RMD in [debug mode](https://github.com/intel/rmd/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#run-the-service), the [port number](https://github.com/intel/rmd-operator/-/blob/master/build/manifests/rmd-pod.yaml#L12) of **build/manifests/rmd-pod.yaml** must be set to `8081` before building the operator. Debug mode is advised for testing only. 

### TLS Enablement
To use the operator with [RMD with TLS enabled](https://github.com/intel/rmd/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#access-using-https-over-tcp-connection-secured-by-tls), the [port number](https://github.com/intel/rmd-operator/blob/9d9d500094849a6e95487f303094ea88817e8b82/build/manifests/rmd-pod.yaml#L12) of **build/manifests/rmd-pod.yaml** must be set to `8443` before building the operator. Sample certificates are provided by the [RMD repository](https://github.com/intel/rmd/tree/master/etc/rmd/cert/client) and should be used for testing only. The user can generate their own certs for production and replace with those existing. The client certs for the RMD operator should be stored in the following locations in this repo before building the operator:

CA: **build/certs/public/ca.pem**

Public Key: **build/certs/public/cert.pem**

Private Key: **build/certs/private/key.pem**

### Build
*Note:* The operator deploys pods with the RMD container. The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/intel/rmd/blob/master/Dockerfile) for this container is located on the [RMD repo](https://github.com/intel/rmd) and is out of scope for this project. 

*Note:* If running behind a proxy server, proxy settings must be configured in the RMD Operator [Dockerfile](https://github.com/intel/rmd-operator/blob/master/build/Dockerfile#L3). 

The pod spec used by the operator to deploy the RMD container is located at **build/manifests/rmd-pod.yaml**. Alterations to the image name/tag should be made here. 


Build binaries and create docker images for the operator and the node agent:

`make all`

*Note:* The Docker images built are `intel-rmd-operator:latest` and `intel-rmd-node-agent:latest`. Once built, these images should be stored in a remote docker repository for use throughout the cluster.

### Deploy
The **deploy** directory contains all specifications for the required RBAC objects. These objects can be inspected and deployed individually or created all at once using rbac.yaml:

`kubectl create -f deploy/rbac.yaml`

Create RmdNodeState CRD:

`kubectl create -f deploy/crds/intel.com_rmdnodestates_crd.yaml`

Create RmdWorkloads CRD:

`kubectl create -f deploy/crds/intel.com_rmdworkloads_crd.yaml`

Create RmdConfigs CRD:

`kubectl create -f deploy/crds/intel.com_rmdconfigs_crd.yaml`

Create Operator Pod:

`kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml`

Note: For the operator to deploy and run RMD instances, an up to date RMD docker image is required.

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

### RmdWorkload
The RmdWorkload custom resource is the object used to define a workload for RMD.
RmdWorkload objects can be created **directly** via the RmdWorkload spec or **automatically** via the pod spec. 

Direct configuration affords the user more control over specific cores and specific nodes on which they wish to configure a particular RmdWorkload. This section describes the direct configuration approach.

Automatic configuration utilizes pod annotations and the `intel.com/l3_cache_ways` extended resource to create an RmdWorkload for the same CPUs that are allocated to the pod.
The automatic configuration approach is described [later](https://github.com/intel/rmd-operator/-/tree/master#pod-requesting-cache-ways). This approach has a number of limitations and is less stable than direct configuration.


#### Examples
See `samples` directory for RmdWorkload templates.

##### Cache
See `samples/rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache.yaml`
````yaml
apiVersion: intel.com/v1alpha1
kind: RmdWorkload
metadata:
    name: rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache
spec:
    coreIds: ["0-3","6","8"]
    rdt:
        cache:
            max: 2
            min: 2
    nodes: ["worker-node-1", "worker-node-2"]
````
This workload requests cache from the guaranteed group for CPUs 0 to 3, 6 and 8 on nodes "worker-node-1" and "worker-node-2". See [intel/rmd](https://github.com/intel/rmd#cache-poolsgroups) for details on cache pools/groups.

**Note**: Replace "worker-node-1" and "worker-node-2" in *nodes* field with the actual node name(s) you wish to target with your RmdWorkload spec. 

Creating this workload is the equivalent of running the following command for each node: 
````
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data \
        '{"core_ids":["0","1","2","3","6","8"],
            "rdt" : { 
                "cache" : {"max": 2, "min": 2 }
            }    
        }' \
        https://hostname:port/v1/workloads
````
##### Memory Bandwidth Allocation (MBA)

**Note:** MBA can only be requested **with** guaranteed cache. See [intel/rmd](https://github.com/intel/rmd) for more information on MBA.

See `samples/rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache-mba.yaml`
````yaml
apiVersion: intel.com/v1alpha1
kind: RmdWorkload
metadata:
    name: rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache-mba
spec:
    coreIds: ["0-3"]
    rdt:
        cache:
            max: 2
            min: 2
        mba:
            percentage: 50
    nodes: ["worker-node-1", "worker-node-2"]
````
This workload requests cache from the guaranteed group for CPUs 0 to 3 on nodes "worker-node-1" and "worker-node-2" while also assigning 50% MBA to those CPUs. See [intel/rmd](https://github.com/intel/rmd#cache-poolsgroups) for details on cache pools/groups.

**Note**: Replace "worker-node-1" and "worker-node-2" in *nodes* field with the actual node name(s) you wish to target with your RmdWorkload spec. 

Creating this workload is the equivalent of running the follwing command for each node: 
````
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data \
        '{"core_ids":["0","1","2","3"],
            "rdt" : { 
                "cache" : {"max": 2, "min": 2 }
                "mba" : {"percentage": 50 }
            }    
        }' \
        https://hostname:port/v1/workloads
````
##### P-State

**Note:** P-State settings are only configurable if the [RMD P-State plugin has been loaded](https://github.com/intel/rmd/blob/master/docs/ConfigurationGuide.md#pstate-section).  

See `samples/rmd-workload-guaranteed-cache-pstate.yaml`
````yaml
apiVersion: intel.com/v1alpha1
kind: RmdWorkload
metadata:
    name: rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache-pstate
spec:
    coreIds: ["4-7"]
    rdt:
        cache:
            max: 2
            min: 2
    plugins:        
        pstate:
            ratio: "3.0"
            monitoring: "on"
    nodes: ["worker-node-1", "worker-node-2"]
````
This workload expands on the previous example with manually specified parameters with P-State plugin enabled. 

Creating this workload is the equivalent of running the following command for each node: 
````
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data \
        '{"core_ids":["4","5","6","7"],
            "rdt": {         
                "cache" : {"max": 2, "min": 2 }
            }
            "plugins" : {
                "pstate" : {"ratio": 3.0, "monitoring" : "on"}
            }
       }' \
       https://hostname:port/v1/workloads
````

##### Create RmdWorkload

`kubectl create -f samples/rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache.yaml`


##### List RmdWorkloads
`kubectl get rmdworkloads`


##### Display a particular RmdWorkload:
`kubectl describe rmdworkload rmd-workload-guaranteed-cache`

````
Name:         rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache
Namespace:    default
API Version:  intel.com/v1alpha1
Kind:         RmdWorkload
Spec:
  Cache:
    Max:  2
    Min:  2
  Core Ids:
    0-3
    6
    8
  Nodes:
    worker-node-1
    worker-node-2
Status:
  Workload States:
    worker-node-1:
      Cos Name:  0-3_6_8-guarantee
      Id:        1
      Response:  Success: 200
      Status:    Successful
    worker-node-2:
      Cos Name:  0-3_6_8-guarantee
      Id:        1
      Response:  Success: 200
      Status:    Successful
````
This displays the RmdWorkload object including the spec as defined above and the status of the workload. Here, the status shows that this workload was configured successfully on nodes "worker-node-1" and "worker-node-2".

##### Delete RmdWorkload
When the user deletes an RmdWorkload object, a delete request is sent to the RMD API on every RMD instance on which that RmdWorkload is configured.

`kubectl delete rmdworkload rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache`

Note: If the user only wishes to delete the RmdWorkload from a specific node, that node should be removed from the RmdWorkload spec's "nodes" field and then apply the RmdWorkload object.

`kubectl apply -f samples/rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache.yaml`

### RmdNodeState
The RmdNodeState custom resource is created for each node in the cluster which has RMD running. The purpose of this object is to allow the user to view all running workloads on a particular node at any given time.
Each RmdNodeState object will be named according to its corresponding node (ie `rmd-node-state-<node-name>`).


##### List all RmdNodeStates on the cluster
`kubectl get rmdnodestates`

##### Display a particular RmdNodeState such as the example above
`kubectl describe rmdnodestate rmd-node-state-worker-node-1`

````
Name:         rmd-node-state-worker-node-1
Namespace:    default
API Version:  intel.com/v1alpha1
Kind:         RmdNodeState
Spec:
  Node:      worker-node-1
  Node UID:  75d03574-6991-4292-8f16-af43a8bfa9a6
Status:
  Workloads:
    rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache:
      Cache Max:  2
      Cache Min:  2
      Core IDs:   0-3,6,8
      Cos Name:   0-3_6_8-guarantee
      ID:         1
      Origin:     REST
      Status:     Successful
    rmdworkload-guaranteed-cache-pstate:
      Cache Max:  2
      Cache Min:  2
      Core IDs:   4-7
      Cos Name:   4-7-guarantee
      ID:         2
      Origin:     REST
      Status:     Successful
````
This example displays the RmdNodeState for worker-node-1. It shows that this node currently has two RMD workloads configured successfully.

## Pod Requesting Cache Ways
It is also possible for the operator to create an RmdWorkload **automatically** by interpreting resource requests and [annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) in the pod spec.

**Warning**: Automatic creation of workloads may be unstable and is **not recommended in production** for the RMD Operator v0.1. However, testing and feedback is welcomed to help stabilize this approach for future releases.

Under this approach, the user creates a pod with a container requesting **exclusive** CPUs from the Kubelet CPU Manager and available cache ways. The pod must also contain RMD specific pod annotations to describe the desired RmdWorkload.
It is then the responsiblity of the operator and the node agent to do the following:
*  Extract the RMD related data passed to the pod spec by the user.
*  Discover which CPUs have been allocated to the container by the CPU Manager.
*  Create the RmdWorkload object based on this information.

The following criteria must be met in order for the operator to succesfully create an RmdWorkload for a container based on the pod spec.
*  The container must request extended resource `intel.com/l3_cache_ways`. 
*  The container must also [request exclusive CPUs from CPU Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/#static-policy).
*  Pod annotations pertaining to the container requesting cache ways must be prefixed with that container's name. See example and [table](https://github.com/nolancon/rmd-operator/blob/v0.2/README.md#pod-annotaions-naming-convention) below.

### Example: Single Container
See `samples/pod-guaranteed-cache.yaml`

````yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-guaranteed-cache
  annotations:
    container1_cache_min: "2"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container1
    image: clearlinux/os-core:latest
    # keep container alive with sleep infinity
    command: [ "sleep" ]
    args: [ "infinity" ]
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: 3
        intel.com/l3_cache_ways: 2
      limits:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: 3
        intel.com/l3_cache_ways: 2
````
This pod spec has one container requesting 3 exclusive CPUs and 2 cache ways. The number of cache ways requested is also interpreted as the value for `max cache` for the RmdWorkload.
The `min cache` value is specified in the pod annotations. The naming convention for RMD workload related annotations **must** follow the [table](https://github.com/nolancon/rmd-operator/blob/v0.2/README.md#pod-annotaions-naming-convention) below.

This pod will trigger the operator to automatically create an RmdWorkload for `container1` called `pod-guaranteed-cache-rmdworkload-container1`

#### Create Pod
`kubectl create -f sample/pod-guaranteed-cache.yaml`

#### Display RmdWorkload
If successful, the RmdWorkload will be created with the naming convention `<pod-name>-rmd-workload-<container-name>`

`kubectl describe rmdworkload pod-guaranteed-cache-rmdworkload-container1`

````
Name:         pod-guaranteed-cache-rmd-workload-container1
Namespace:    default
API Version:  intel.com/v1alpha1
Kind:         RmdWorkload
Spec:
  Core Ids:
    1
    2
    49
  Nodes:
    worker-node-1

Status:
  Workload States:
    worker-node-1:
      Cos Name:  1_2_49-guarantee
      Id:        22
      Response:  Success: 200
      Status:    Successful
`````
This output displays the RmdWorkload which has been created succesfully based on the pod spec created above.
Note that CPUs 1,2 and 49 have been allocated to the container by the CPU Manager. As this RmdWorkload was created automatically via the pod spec, **the user has no control over which CPUs are used by the container**. 
In order to explicitly define which CPUs are to be allocated cache ways, the RmdWorkload must be created directly via the RmdWorkload spec and not the pod spec.

### Example: Multiple Containers
See `samples/pod-multi-guaranteed-cache-mba.yaml`

````yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-multi-guaranteed-cache-mba
  annotations:
    container1_cache_min: "2"
    container2_cache_min: "2"
    container2_mba_percentage: "50"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container1
    image: clearlinux/os-core:latest
    # keep container alive with sleep infinity
    command: [ "sleep" ]
    args: [ "infinity" ]
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: 2
        intel.com/l3_cache_ways: 2
      limits:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: 2
        intel.com/l3_cache_ways: 2
  - name: container2
    image: clearlinux/os-core:latest
    # keep container alive with sleep infinity
    command: [ "sleep" ]

      limits:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: 2
        intel.com/l3_cache_ways: 2
````
This pod spec has two container requesting 2 exclusive CPUs and 2 cache ways. The number of cache ways requested is also interpreted as the value for `max cache` for the RmdWorkload.
The `min cache` values are specified for each container by prefixing the container name to the pod annotations.
The `mba_percentage` value is also specified for `container2` in the pod annotations.
The naming convention for RMD workload related annotations **must** follow the [table](https://github.com/nolancon/rmd-operator/blob/v0.2/README.md#pod-annotaions-naming-convention) below.

This pod will trigger the operator to automatically create **two** RmdWorkloads. One for `container1` called `pod-multi-guaranteed-cache-mba-rmdworkload-container1` and one for `container2` called `pod-multi-guaranteed-cache-mba-rmdworkload-container2` 
 
#### Create Pod
`kubectl create -f sample/pod-multi-guaranteed-cache-mba.yaml`

#### Display RmdWorkloads
If successful, the RmdWorkloads will be created with the naming convention `<pod-name>-rmd-workload-<container-name>`
 
`kubectl describe rmdworkload pod-guaranteed-cache-rmdworkload-container1`

This output displays the RmdWorkload created succesfully for `container2` based on the pod spec created above.

### Pod Annotaions Naming Convention
**Note**: Annotations **must** be prefixed with the relevant container name as shown below.
|  Specification | Container Name | Required Annotaion Name |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cache Minimum | container1 | container1_cache_min |
| Policy | container1 | container1_policy |
| P-State Ratio | container2 | container2_pstate_ratio |
| P-State Monitoring | test-container | test-container_pstate_monitoring |
| MBA Percentage | test-container-1 | test-container-1_mba_percentage |
| MBA Mbps | test-container2 | test-container2_mba_mbps |

Failure to follow the provided annotation naming convention will result in failure to create the desired workload. 

### Delete Pod and RmdWorkload
When an RmdWorkload is created by the operator based on a pod spec, that pod object becomes the owner of the RmdWorkload object it creates. Therefore when a pod that owns an RmdWorkload (or multiple RmdWorkloads) is deleted, all of its RmdWorkload children are automatically garbage collected and thus removed from RMD.

`kubectl delete pod rmd-workload-guaranteed-cache-pod-86676`

### Limitations in Creating RmdWorkloads via Pod Spec
*  Automatic configuration is only achievalbe with the native Kubernetes CPU Manager static policy.
*  The user has no control over which CPUs are configured with the automatically created RmdWorkload policy as the CPU Manager is in charge of CPU allocation.


Creating an RmdWorkload automatically via a pod spec is far less reliable than creating directly via an RmdWorkload spec. This is because the user no longer has the ability to explicitly define the specific CPUs on which the RmdWorkload will ultimately be configured.
CPU allocation for containers is the responsibility of the CPU Manager in Kubelet. As a result, the RmdWorkload will only be created **after** the pod is admitted. Once the RmdWorkload is created by the operator, the RmdWorkload information is sent to RMD in the form of an HTTPS post request. 
Should the post to RMD fail at this point for any reason, the operator will then terminate the pod and by association the RmdWorkload.

To discover why the pod was terminated by the operator it is necessary to check the opertor pod's logs.

#### Example

`kubectl logs intel-rmd-operator-6464fcfb94-4cvqn | grep guaranteed-cache-pod-9wbk9 -A 1`

#### Example Output

`{"level":"info","ts":1591601591.2043474,"logger":"controller_rmdworkload","msg":"Workload not found on RMD instance, create.","Request.Namespace":"default","Request.Name":"rmd-workload-guaranteed-cache-pod-2dnwh"}
